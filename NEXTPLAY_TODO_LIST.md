# NextPlay Implementation Todo List

## File Contents Summary

### `/docs/README.md`
Describes the "Game Sync" project - a real-time sports data synchronization platform featuring live game event updates, game schedule display, data synchronization from multiple providers, serverless AWS architecture, and Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.

### `/docs/api-specs.md`
Defines AWS AppSync GraphQL API with types for GameEvent, GameSchedule, and GameSync. Includes partial schema with sport_id, game_id, timestamps, and provider_id fields. References Amplify configuration for frontend connection.

### `/docs/architecture.md`
Outlines the technical architecture: Angular frontend on AWS Amplify, AWS AppSync GraphQL API with Events for real-time data, DynamoDB storage, Lambda functions for business logic, and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

### `/docs/data-models.md`
Specifies DynamoDB table structures: game_events table with partition keys (sport_id, game_id) and sort key (timestamp), game_schedule table with partition keys (sport_id, provider_id, game_id) and sort key (start_timestamp).

### `/docs/deployment.md`
Details deployment process using Terraform for infrastructure (with CloudFormation for AppSync Event APIs) and AWS Amplify for the Angular application. Lists specific AWS resources needed.

### `/docs/specs/` (HCL Files)
Contains infrastructure specifications:
- **game_events.hcl**: DynamoDB table config and Lightsail instance for game event updates
- **game_schedule.hcl**: DynamoDB table config and Lambda function for hourly schedule updates
- **game_sync.hcl**: AppSync and Amplify service definitions

### `/docs/todo/` (8 Implementation Phases)
Comprehensive 8-phase implementation plan covering data model refactor, backend integration, frontend development, authentication, betting logic, demo features, testing/deployment, and legal compliance.

### `/docs/primefaces-primeng-8a5edab282632443.txt`
Massive PrimeNG library structure documentation (not directly relevant to core implementation).
